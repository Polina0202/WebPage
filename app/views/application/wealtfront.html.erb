        The effectiveness of the Tax-Loss Harvesting strategy to reduce the tax
        liability of the client will depend on the client’s entire tax and
        investment profile, including purchases and dispositions in a client’s
        (or client’s spouse’s) accounts outside of Wealthfront Advisers and
        type of investments (e.g., taxable or nontaxable) or holding period
        (e.g., short- term or long-term).Tax loss harvesting may generate a
        higher number of trades due to attempts to capture losses. There is a
        chance that trading attributed to tax loss harvesting may create capital
        gains and wash sales and could be subject to higher transaction costs
        and market impacts. In addition, tax loss harvesting strategies may
        produce losses, which may not be offset by sufficient gains in the
        account and may be limited to a $3,000 deduction against income. The
        utilization of losses harvested through the strategy will depend upon
        the recognition of capital gains in the same or a future tax period,
        and in addition may be subject to limitations under applicable tax laws,
        e.g., if there are insufficient realized gains in the tax period,
        the use of harvested losses may be limited to a $3,000 deduction
        against income and distributions. Losses harvested through the
        strategy that are not utilized in the tax period when recognized
        (e.g., because of insufficient capital gains and/or significant
        capital loss carryforwards), generally may be carried forward to
        offset future capital gains, if any.
